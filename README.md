# Experimental foundation for an API server

## Introduction

This project is an experiment to:
a) learn Golang.
b) create the core components of an API server, to be used in several projects I have planned.
c) determine the right choice of technologies for a high performance, reliable service.

## Goals (TBD)

- Add oauth2 support for user authentication
- Use external file (yaml or json) for configuration
